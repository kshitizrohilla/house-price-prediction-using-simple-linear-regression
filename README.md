# Simple Linear Regression Example: House Price Prediction

This is a sample project that demonstrates how to use simple linear regression to predict the price of a house given its area in square feet. Given these house prices we can find out the prices of the houses based on the house area.

We will be predicting the house prices of an area using a machine learning technique called simple linear regression. We have the prices of the houses based on the area of that house.

## Requirements

This project requires Python 3 and the following Python libraries:

* NumPy
* Pandas
* Matplotlib
* scikit-learn

These libraries can be installed using pip:

```
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib scikit-learn
```

## Usage

To use this project, simply clone or download the repository, navigate to the project directory, and run the analysis.ipynb Jupyter Notebook. This Notebook contains the code and explanations for loading and exploring the dataset, training a linear regression model, and visualizing the results.

The Notebook is divided into sections that correspond to different parts of the analysis, and each section includes detailed comments and explanations. You can run each section by clicking on the cell and pressing Shift+Enter.
